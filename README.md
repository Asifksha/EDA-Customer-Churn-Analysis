Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)- Customer Churn Analysis.
 The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer
 dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about customer behavior and service usage.
 The dataset contains multiple features related to customer demographics, service subscriptions,
 and billing information, as well as a target variable Churn, indicating whether a customer has
 left the service
  The EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, highlighting key patterns and
 relationships that can guide business strategies for customer retention. By analyzing service
 usage, billing preferences, and demographic factors, the project uncovers actionable insights to
 reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction
